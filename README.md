## Strava Running Activity Analysis
### Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of running activity data collected from Strava. The objective is to understand patterns and trends in running behavior, including distance, pace, duration, and frequency of activities over time.

The analysis uses real-world personal activity data to demonstrate practical data analytics skills such as data preprocessing, visualization, and insight generation.

### Dataset
- Source: Strava (exported personal activity data)
- Format: CSV
- Activity Type: Running
- Metrics Analyzed:
  - Distance
  - Duration
  - Pace
  - Activity frequency
  - Temporal patterns (daily / weekly trends)

### Tools & Libraries
1. Python
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn

### Analysis Performed
The following analyses were conducted:
1. Distribution of running distance and duration
2. Pace analysis across activities
3. Weekly and monthly running trends
4. Activity frequency over time
5. Identification of consistency patterns in running habits

### Key Findings
- Running activity shows variation in distance and pace across sessions
- Consistent running patterns are observable over specific time periods
- Pace tends to stabilize as running frequency increases
- Weekly trends highlight preferred running days

### Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how exploratory data analysis can be applied to personal fitness data to extract meaningful insights about physical activity behavior. The project highlights the importance of data-driven reflection in understanding performance trends and habit consistency.
